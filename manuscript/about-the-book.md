# About The Book

This book is a follow-up on Liran Tal's [Essential Node.js Security for Express web applications](https://leanpub.com/essential-nodejs-security/) and teaches you hands-on practical use of HTTP security headers as browser security controls to help secure web applications.

For each HTTP security header that can enhance your web application security, you'll learn what is the overall risk of not implementing it, and what does a proposed solution help with. Finally, you'll learn how to implement and configure the security header with Helmet, a popular and well-maintained Node.js package on npm.

This book includes 18 Lessons, 8 Quizzes, 30 Code Snippets, and 19 Illustrations to help you level up on your HTTP security headers skills, and includes:

- Secure web applications using HTTP security headers
- Understand Content Security Policy
- Setup Node.js web applications securely
